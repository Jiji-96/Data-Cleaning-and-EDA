The aim of this code is to perform EDA and initial Cleaning on a row_house_data dataset. 
In order to justify all choices plots, charts and deletions must be produced.

the file on which everything was done is: main_code_google_drive_data.ipynb
extract_data_from_my_computer.ipynb file was the first way I tried to extract data, but found out it was not the best option
