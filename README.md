The aim of this code is to perform EDA and initial Cleaning on a row_house_data dataset. 
In order to justify all choices, plots, charts and deletions must be produced.

The file on which everything was done is: main_code_google_drive_data.ipynb.
Initially I uploaded the dataset from my computer and created extract_data_from_my_computer.ipynb, but figured out this was not the best way to do it.
